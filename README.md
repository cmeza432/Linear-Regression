# Linear-Regression
This file applies Linear Regression to fit a polynomial function to the given data. There is two text files as well, these two files are the datasets. The Training is used to build the model and the Testing file is used to fit the data after the training phase. The datasets are a 2d array and each row is a X of xn values except for the last row which is the Class it belongs too.

## Inputs
This code takes four inputs in the command line:

* ** Training File name **
* ** Degree(int between 1 and 10) which specifies the value of φ **
* ** λ(non negative real number which is used for regularization) **
* ** Testing file name **
